In this paper, we propose that the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) and travel time of the first millisecond of the echo train are sufficient cues supporting obstacle avoidance in echolocating bats.

{"title": "Darker eggs of mosquitoes resist more to dry conditions: Melanin enhances serosal cuticle contribution in egg resistance to desiccation in Aedes, Anopheles and Culex vectors", "predicted summary": "Mosquito vectors lay their eggs in aquatic environments during early embryogenesis but eggs shrink and perish within two hours if removed from moisture during mid-embryogenesis. During mid-embryogenesis, cells secrete the serosal cuticle, localized right below the outermost eggshell layer, which greatly reduces water flow and allows egg survival outside the water. The degree of egg resistance to desiccation at late embryogenesis differs among species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles aquasalis and Culex quinquefasciatus eggs survive in dry environments for 72, 24 and 5 hours longer than lighter eggs."}

We find several functions to have significantly gained or lost genes significantly between normal and cancer samples, not due differential expression of genes known to perform functions but rather due to changes in the network topology between normal and cancer samples.

The early time periods after infection define critical host processes that determine ultimate success or failure of virus to establish infection in mosquitoes. We performed genome-wide genome-wide transcriptome profiling between susceptible and refractory A. aegypti strains at two critical early periods after challenging them with DENV. We identified genes associated with energy metabolism and DNA degradation genes that respond coordinately in response to infection with both susceptible strains after challenging them with DENV infection. Our data revealed extensive transcriptional networks of genes that respond coordinately in response to infection with both susceptible strains at critical critical early periods after challenging them with DENV infection between susceptible strains at critical early periods after challenging them with DENV infection, suggesting that successfully defending against viral infection requires more elaborate gene networks than hosting viruses."}

Hitchhiking Index measures the probability that any observed candidate gene is passenger alteration, given the frequency of mutation accumulation and selection in colorectal tissue prior to cancer initiation as well as during tumorigenesis.

{"title": "Multi-dose Romidepsin Reactivates Replication Competent SIV in Post-antiretroviral Rhesus Macaque Controllers", "predicted summary": "Viral reservoirs that persist during antiretroviral treatment preclude definitive treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals, requiring lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART). Strategies proposed for targeting these reservoirs include induce expression of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), resulting in elimination of the affected cells through viral cytolysis or immune clearance mechanisms. However, these strategies have variable efficacy for reactivating viral reservoirs during post-treatment control of SIV-specific immune responses. Here we investigated the ability of the HDACi HDACi romidepsin (RMD) to reactivate SIV-specific immune responses following early and prolonged administration of antiretroviral treatment and evaluated the impact of HDACi treatment on SIV-specific responses. Our results suggest that HDACi treatment on SIV-specific immune responses is transient and does not irreversibly alter the ability of SIV-specific immune responses to control SIV-specific responses."}

Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a comprehensive structural framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations. The objective function to be used in such optimization algorithms is directly linked with the biological hypothesis underlying the model. We propose Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl), which decouples the artifacts of metabolic representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions by casting objective functions using metabolic turnover turnovers rather than fluxes rather than fluxes. By simulating perturbed metabolic networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that the use of stoichiometry representation independent algorithms is fundamental for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation."}

{"title": "Reinforcement Learning on Slow Features of High-Dimensional Input Streams", "predicted summary": "Animals and humans are capable of learning complex behaviors based on a massive stream of sensory information from different modalities. Early animal studies have identified learning mechanisms that are based on reward and punishment such that animals tend to avoid actions that lead to punishment. However, most algorithms for reward-based learning are only applicable if the state-space structure of the state-space is sufficiently small or its structure sufficiently simple. The question arises how the problem of learning on high-dimensional data is solved in the brain. In this article, we propose a biologically plausible generic two-stage learning architecture that can directly be applied directly applied to raw high-dimensional input streams. We demonstrate by computer simulations that this generic architecture is able to learn quite demanding reinforcement learning tasks on high-dimensional input streams in a time comparable to the time needed when an explicit highly informative low-dimensional state representation is given instead of the high-dimensional input stream."}

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often focus on the relationship between disease risk and genetic variants one marker at a time. However, single genetic variants typically explain small proportions of the variance in biological intermediates of interest. We constructed allelic scores that explain greater proportions of variance in biological intermediates of interest. We found that allelic scores derived from known variants and allelic scores derived from hundreds of thousands of genetic markers explained significant portions of variance in biological intermediates of interest, suggesting that they should only proxy biological intermediates for which there are no known individual variants for which there are no known individual variants. We conclude that our approach represents a simple way in which potentially potentially potentially thousands molecular intermediates could be screened for causal relationships with disease without having to expensively measure individual variants individually."}

We identify six thermodynamic quantities essential for characterizing system behavior as a function of network size: internal potential energy, entropy, free potential energy, internal pressure, pressure, bulk modulus, and bulk modulus. We attribute this novel result to a reallocation of ground states (global minima) of the system caused by intrinsic noise-induced deformation of its topographic surface caused by noise-induced deformation of its topographic surface. Further analyses demonstrate appreciable levels of intrinsic noise can cause complex modes of operation that dominate system dynamics at nearcritical or subcritical network sizes."}

In this study, we developed a simple model using readily available laboratory data to accurately predict acute kidney injury (AKI) within 24 hours of a given observation. We found that using readily available laboratory data could be easily integrated into existing electronic health record systems without sacrificing the performance seen seen in more complex models."}

We find that dominant hybrid male introgressions outnumber dominant hybrid male introgressions and hybrid male introgressions outnumber dominant hybrid male introgressions outnumber dominant hybrid male introgressions, consistent with dominance theories of Haldane's rule and faster-male theories of Haldane's rule. Our results thus confirm Haldane's rule and identify its proximate cause: hybrid male introgressions have higher density on the X chromosome segments than autosomal introgressions."}

Here, we define a novel structural feature termed regulation entropy, termed regulation entropy, to quantitatively assess the influence of regulatory features on the robustness of biological control networks. We first demonstrate the correlation between regulation entropy and dynamic stability of biological control networks, and then establish a significant association between regulation entropy and dynamic stability of biological control networks. We further establish general generality of this approach with a broad spectrum of biological and random networks. Our work suggests that regulation entropy is an effective order parameter in evaluating the robustness of biological control networks."}

{"title": "A Single-Rate Context-Dependent Learning Process Underlies Rapid Adaptation to Familiar Object Dynamics", "predicted summary": "Motor learning has been extensively studied using dynamic perturbations that induce movement errors that result in progressive changes to motor commands observed in such studies. Motor learning typically occurs over tens to hundreds of trials when subjects rotate objects with known dynamics. However, when subjects manipulate objects with familiar dynamics, subjects adapt rapidly within a few trials. Here we apply state-space models to familiar dynamics, asking whether adaptation is mediated by a single-rate process or dual-rate process associated with novel dynamics. The model predicts that during exposure to the object across multiple orientations, there will be a degree of independence for adaptation and de-adaptation during exposure across multiple orientations across multiple orientations, and that the states associated with all orientations will slowly de-adapt during exposure across multiple orientations."}

We have used PAR-CLIP to map the position of termination complexes genome-wide in living yeast cells after removal of components of either the polyadenylation pathway or non-polyadenylation pathway components from yeast cells. We show here that deletion of components of either the polyadenylation pathway does not lead to readthrough transcription but leads to widespread runaway readthrough at non-polyadenylation transcription. Depletion of components of either the polyadenylation pathway leads to runaway readthrough at non-polyadenylation terminators, but this readthrough is less processive or more susceptible to pausing."}

We identified two new loci of genome-wide significance at 3q26.33 near SOX2 (rs1345417: P = 6.511010) and near FOXD1 (rs12651896: P = 1.73108) flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank flank"}
{"title": "Trichuris suis and Oesophagostomum dentatum Show Different Sensitivity and Accumulation of Fenbendazole, Albendazole and Levamisole In Vitro", "predicted summary": "Comparative drug uptake of Trichuris suis and Oesophagostomum dentatum in vitro suggests higher detoxifying capacity of Trichuris suis as compared to Oesophagostomum dentatum. Comparisons of drug uptake between living and killed Trichuris species were made between living and killed Trichuris species. The motility and concentrations of drug compounds within living and killed Trichuris species were significantly lower within Trichuris suis than Oesophagostomum Dentatum when incubated for 72 hours in fenbendazole, albendazole and albendazole respectively. Comparisons of drug compounds within living and killed Trichuris were made between living and killed Trichuris species. Comparisons of drug compounds within living and killed Trichuris species were significantly lower within Trichuris suis than Oesophagostomum Dentatum.

{"title": "Describing the Breakbone Fever: IDODEN, an Ontology for Dengue Fever", "predicted summary": "Dengue fever is transmitted globally by mosquitoes transmitted by mosquitoes and is one of the most important vector-borne diseases transmitted by mosquitoes globally. To address the need to expand the toolbox available for the control and prevention of vector-borne diseases we embarked on the construction of specific ontologies that describe diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. We constructed IDODEN using open source software and built it on IDOMAL, the malaria malaria ontology developed previously. We constructed IDODEN using open source software and constructed it using open source open source open source software. IDODEN covers all aspects of dengue fever, including disease biology, epidemiology and clinical features. IDODEN covers all aspects of dengue fever, including disease biology, epidemiology and clinical features."}
